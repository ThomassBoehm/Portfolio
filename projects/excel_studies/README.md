# 📊 Applied Mathematics & Engineering Calculations

This directory serves as a practical archive of my engineering studies, featuring a consolidated Excel workbook used for academic exercises and complex calculations.

The focus of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of numerical analysis and mathematical modeling using spreadsheet logic, bridging the gap between theoretical math and engineering problem-solving.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Each worksheet within the file represents a specific subject or problem set addressed during my coursework:

* **Interpolation:** Implementation of Linear and Quadratic interpolation techniques for data estimation.
* **Linear Algebra:** Step-by-step logic for Gaussian Elimination (specifically applied to 4x4 matrices).
* **Calculus & Dynamics:**
    * **Euler Method:** First-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
    * **Runge–Kutta Method:** Iterative method for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations.
* **Numerical Analysis:** Iterative methods, function approximation, and specific differential equation applications.
