# 📊 Sales Analytics & Data Modeling Study

This project is an academic exploration of Microsoft Power BI, designed to master the fundamentals of business intelligence, data relationships, and interactive visualization.

Using a generic sales database, this project simulates a real-world analytical scenario. The primary goal was to understand how to effectively "interlace" different data sheets (creating relationships between tables), integrate external data sources, and unlock the full potential of Power BI's visualization tools.

## 🚀 Key Concepts & Features

* **Data Modeling & Relationships:** Built a robust data model by connecting multiple tables (e.g., Sales, Products, Stores) to enable dynamic cross-filtering and accurate reporting.
* **DAX Measures:** Applied Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to calculate key metrics, such as total revenue, average order value, and year-over-year growth.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Designed user-friendly dashboards featuring slicers, drill-throughs, and dynamic charts to visualize sales trends across different regions and time periods.
* **Data Integration:** Practiced transforming and loading (ETL) raw data from diverse sources into a unified structure suitable for analysis.
