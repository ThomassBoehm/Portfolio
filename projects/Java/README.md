☕ Java Exercises Repository

Academic Project | Java

This directory contains practical exercises developed throughout my Java classes.
It is a work in progress, continuously updated as new concepts are introduced during the course.

The main objective is to strengthen programming fundamentals, code organization, and best practices.

Purpose: Practice programming logic and core Java concepts.

Status: 🚧 Ongoing development (updated as the course progresses).

Structure: Exercises organized individually by file.

Each file represents an independent exercise focused on a specific concept currently being studied (conditional statements, loops, methods, object-oriented programming, etc.).
